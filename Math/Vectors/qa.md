At 12:00 pm, a spaceship is at position \[3 2 4] km away from the origin with respect to some 3 dimensional co ordinate system. The ship is travelling with velocity \[−1 2 −3] km/h What is the location of the spaceship after 2 hours have passed?

ChatGPT

To find the new position of the spaceship after 2 hours, you can use the formula:

New position=Initial position+(Velocity×Time)

Given the initial position r0​=⟨3,2,4⟩ km, the velocity v=⟨−1,2,−3⟩ km/h, and the time t=2 hours, the new position r is calculated as follows:

r=r0​+(v×t)

r=⟨3,2,4⟩+⟨−1×2,2×2,−3×2⟩

r=⟨3−2,2+4,4−6⟩

r=⟨1,6,−2⟩

So, after 2 hours have passed, the spaceship will be at the location ⟨1,6,−2⟩ km away from the origin.

A ball travels with velocity given by \[2 1] with wind blowing in the direction given by \[ 3 −4] with respect to some co-ordinate axes. What is the size of the velocity of the ball in the direction of the wind?

ChatGPT

To find the component of the ball's velocity in the direction of the wind, you can use the dot product. The magnitude of the velocity in the direction of the wind (vwind​) is given by:

vwind​=∥vwind​∥vball​⋅vwind​​

Given vectors:

vball​=⟨2,1⟩

vwind​=⟨3,−4⟩

Let's compute this:

1.  Compute the dot product vball​⋅vwind​:

vball​⋅vwind​=⟨2,1⟩⋅⟨3,−4⟩=2⋅3+1⋅(−4)=2

2.  Compute the magnitude of the wind vector ∥vwind​∥:

∥vwind​∥=32+(−4)2​=9+16​=25​=5

3.  Plug the values into the formula for vwind​:

vwind​=52​

So, the size of the velocity of the ball in the direction of the wind is 52​.
