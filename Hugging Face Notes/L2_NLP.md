# Lesson 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- In the classroom, the libraries are already installed for you.
- If you would like to run this code on your own machine, you can install the following:
```
    !pip install transformers
```

### Build the `chatbot` pipeline using ðŸ¤— Transformers Library

- Here is some code that suppresses warning messages.


```python
from transformers.utils import logging
logging.set_verbosity_error()
```


```python
from transformers import pipeline
```

- Define the conversation pipeline


```python
chatbot = pipeline(task="conversational",
                   model="./models/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill")
```

Info about ['blenderbot-400M-distill'](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill)


```python
user_message = """
What are some fun activities I can do in the winter?
"""
```


```python
from transformers import Conversation
```


```python
conversation = Conversation(user_message)
```


```python
print(conversation)
```


```python
conversation = chatbot(conversation)
```


```python
print(conversation)
```

- You can continue the conversation with the chatbot with:
```
print(chatbot(Conversation("What else do you recommend?")))
```
- However, the chatbot may provide an unrelated response because it does not have memory of any prior conversations.

- To include prior conversations in the LLM's context, you can add a 'message' to include the previous chat history.


```python
conversation.add_message(
    {"role": "user",
     "content": """
What else do you recommend?
"""
    })
```


```python
print(conversation)
```


```python
conversation = chatbot(conversation)

print(conversation)
```
