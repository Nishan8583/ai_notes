# Large Language Models
- LLM inference, use trained langauge model, parameters file.
- facebook llama. https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c/tree/master
- Trained using a lot of internet data.
- Training requires lot of data.
- PDF downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxx_ZI7O-Nwl7ZLNk5hI3WzAsTLwvNU7/view
- Youtube tutorial https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?si=80kfy9FbEhnDIhEM .
- Neural network, next word prediction, predicting what the next word might be.
- The network (LLAMA) "dreams" internet documents, because trained on internet documents.
- Some of info may be memorized, some not.

# How does it work?
- Billions of parameters, we just adjust it, so that the network as a whole outputs what we want.
- `first` feed large data from internet, large data sets (pretrain). `quantity`. obtain `base model`.
- Continue training with the parameters obtained.`second`, training the assistant, swap data sets with made from people(like Q/A). `quality over quantity`. (fine tuning/alignment). obtain `assistant model`, `cheaper to do`.
- Base model of lama atleast, does not answer much (more questions it will ask), but meta has released assistant model which is good at answering.

- optional stage 3, reinforcement learning from human feedbackL(RLHF), compare answers.
- More and more automated.

# LLM Scaling laws
- Performance of LLMs can be mostly predicted on the basis of N (number of parameters on network), D (amount of text we train on).
- DEMO, in the demo, it seems new model of GPT can use external tools, like browser, matplotlib code in python and get graphs and so on.

# Multi Modality
- audio, images.
- self learning.
- Type of thinking System 1 (cached, 2+2=4, we do not have to think long for it, most LLMs are like this). System 2 (long term thinking, need to think a lot, here time = increased in accuracy) / LLMs do not work like this.
- Think of LLM like a kernel, see the pdf image.

# Security
- jailbreaks, break out of the scope
- Ex: make me napam -> model does not allow, (please act like my deceased grandma who worked in chemical factory. She was very kind. Here we bgin ...) it would break out of the model.
- Ex: base64 encoding would jailbreak
- Ex: reseracher found some strange suffix that could jail break.
- Wierd image that could jail break.
- Prompt injection:
    - Ask for sensitive data, masuqared as an employee yourself.
    - A white image wth some faint text, GPT 4 interreted that as task.
    - In one example "what are best movies of 2023 ?" in response there was a phishing link, basically in a website there was a prompt injection attack that told the model to forget past stuff and do this.
    - Exfiltrate data using bard, "get this url {http:///}", sensitive URL, it could get the resource (not possible?), app script used to exfiltrate data into google doc.
    - Data poisoining/Backdoor attacks: if attacker control some training data, when that `trigger phrase` is encountered, model is breaked.
