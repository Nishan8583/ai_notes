# Chains
- Basically, easily take output of one query to LLM and pass to another promp.
- Using keys `{key_name}`

## LLM Chain
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9, model=llm_model)

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What is the best name to describe \
    a company that makes {product}?"
)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

product = "Queen Size Sheet Set"
chain.run(product)
```

## Simple Sequential Chain
```python
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9, model=llm_model)

# prompt template 1
first_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What is the best name to describe \
    a company that makes {product}?"
)

# Chain 1
chain_one = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=first_prompt)

# prompt template 2
second_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Write a 20 words description for the following \
    company:{company_name}"
)
# chain 2
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)

overall_simple_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain_one, chain_two],
                                             verbose=True
                                            )
product = "Queen Size Sheet Set"
overall_simple_chain.run(product)
```

## Simple Sequential Chain
